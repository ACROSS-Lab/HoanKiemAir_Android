# How to Set Up HoanKiem Air Project  
 ### Set up with GAMA Model
To run a GAMA model with full features. I recommend using the GIT version to run the model. With GAMA running in the eclipse, it will make it easier for developers to figure out where the model's errors are. You can find the download GAMA git version here:  GIT version
After install Git version successfully, you can do following step to run HoanKiem Air model: <br>
  <ol>
  <li>Step 1: In the ‘ummisco.gama.product’ plugin, open the ‘gama.runtime.product’ file </li><br>
  <li>Step 2: Go to “Overview” tab and click on Synchronize </li> <br>
  <li>Step 3: Click on Launch an Eclipse Application and point to the workspace of GAMA that contains the HoanKiem Air model. </li><br>
  </ol>
Now, the HoanKiem Air model in GAMA is ready to go.

 ### Set up with Android App 
To complete the project, you must run an Android application. Setting an Android app will be easier than setting the GAMA model. First thing that you need to run the Android app is to download Android Studio ( https://developer.android.com/studio )and run the HoanKiem Air Controller Program Directory. 
<br>
Then, you need to choose which device you will use to visualize an Android app (**Virtual Device** or **Physical Device**). 
And there are few steps to create a device, following these documentation to create (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator or https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device). 
After creating a device for visualizing, the HoanKiem Air project is ready to run.
